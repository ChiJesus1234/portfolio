 <h2>About Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am a certified health coach and the founder of <strong>Fit Nutrition</strong>,
    a wellness brand focused on plant-based nutrition, gut health, and sustainable
    lifestyle practices.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through my work in health coaching, I have supported individuals with nutrition
    education, fermented foods, smoothies, and practical wellness guidance,
    especially within the Nigerian context.
  </p>

  <p>
    To scale my impact and build smarter health solutions, I am currently training
    as a <strong>software developer at Educare Technology</strong>, learning
    programming and web development. My goal is to combine health expertise with
    technology to create tools, platforms, and digital products that make wellness
    education more accessible and effective.
